# AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap

AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap enables customers to perform security investigations on AWS service logs by providing an Amazon Athena analysis environment that's quick to deploy, ready to use, and easy to maintain. 

If you're ready to deploy Athena Analytics Bootstrap, jump directly to [Deploying AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap](#deploying-aws-security-analytics-bootstrap)

## AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap Use Cases
AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap is for Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers who need a quick method to setup Athena and perform investigations on AWS service logs archived in Amazon S3 buckets.  

AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap is designed to be ready to use for common security investigation use-cases, quick to deploy, and easy to maintain.  AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap provides AWS CloudFormation templates to quickly create a fully configured Athena analysis environment including an Amazon Athena Workgroup, AWS Glue Databases, AWS Glue Tables, and Demo Athena Queries.  AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap supports common security investigation requirements including partitioning and searches across multiple accounts, regions, and dates.  AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap uses [Partition Projection with Amazon Athena](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/partition-projection.html) to provide dynamic partitioning across accounts, regions, and dates without any additional infrastructure, code or frequent maintenance.  Partitioning AWS service log data by account, region, and/or date will enable AWS customers to create targeted queries reducing their cost and query times.

### Common Use Cases for AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap are When AWS Customers:
- Want to search AWS service logs natively in AWS
- Currently have no SIEM available/accessible
- Need to search logs beyond SIEM retention period
- Don't have the required AWS service logs indexed in the SIEM
- Need to investigate an AWS account which hasn't been centralizing its logs

## AWS Service Logs Currently Supported by AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap
 AWS Service Log | Event Type 
------|------|
[AWS CloudTrail](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudtrail/index.html) | AWS API Events (Management and Data Events)
[Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) | Network Events

*NOTE:* We will be adding support for additional AWS Service Logs commonly used in security investigations, please feel free to submit or upvote your requests in `Issues`

## AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap Architecture Overview

![Athena Bootstrap Single Account Architecture](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/docs/img/architecture/SingleAccount.png "Athena Bootstrap Single Account Architecture") |  ![Athena Bootstrap Cross-Account Architecture](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/docs/img/architecture/MultiAccount.png "Athena Bootstrap Cross-Account Architecture")

## Deploying AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap

### Prerequisites
- AWS service logs (e.g. AWS CloudTrail, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, Amazon Route 53 Resolver Query Logs, Amazon ALB Logs) must be delivered to Amazon S3 buckets unmodified in their native format
- For [cross-account deployments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cross-account-permissions.html) bucket policies must be in place and objects need to be owned by the bucket account owner to enable cross-account access
- For logs encrypted via AWS KMS the AWS IAM principal(s) that will be used to submit Athena queries will need to have permissions for `kms:Decrypt` and `kms:DescribeKey` in their IAM policy and the KMS key policy will need to grant them the same access

### Getting Started


The [Athena Infrastructure CloudFormation Template](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/cfn/Athena_infra_setup.yml) will deploy a fully functional security analytics environment including:

Resource | Notes
---------|--------
**Athena Workgroup** | - Configured to provide encrypted output to a specified S3 location<br>- Includes pre-configured demo queries as Named Queries
**Glue Database** | - Contains associated Glue Tables
**Glue Tables** | Standardized table schemas with dynamic partitions for account, region, and date for:<br>- CloudTrail Logs<br>- VPC Flow Logs<br>- Route53 DNS Resolver Logs 

**Deployment time:** ~10 minutes

Comments are provided in the Parameters section to assist with the parameters required for deployment, and a detailed walk-through of the deployment process is provided in the [AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap CDK Deployment Guide](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/docs/aws_security_analytics_bootstrap_cdk_deployment_guide.md) or [AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap Cloudformation Deployment Guide](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/docs/aws_security_analytics_bootstrap_cfn_deployment_guide.md) if you prefer to deploy using native cloudformation. *Note:* Using the CDK to deploy is the recommended option. Cloudformation is less effecient than using the CDK as it cannot dynamically determine logging configuration settings in the target AWS account and does not support concurrent multi-region config for data sources that log on a per region basis such as ELBs/ALBs.

## AWS Security Analytics Bootstrap Resources
*Note:* The [Athena Infrastructure CloudFormation Template](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/cfn/Athena_infra_setup.yml) can be deployed by itself or in combination with any of the additional resources depending on customers' use case(s) and requirements.

| Resource Type | Resource | Resource Provides | Cleanup/Removal Notes | 
|  :--- | :---         | :---      |   :---        |    
| AWS CloudFormation Template | [Athena Infrastructure CloudFormation Template](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/cfn/Athena_infra_setup.yml)   | Creates the ready-to-use Athena security analytics environment including: Athena Workgroup, Glue Database, Glue Tables, and demo Named Queries.yy | All resources created by this template will be deleted when the CloudFormation Stack is deleted.  This will not affect the source log data. |
| AWS CloudFormation Template | [IAM Roles and Policies for Athena Admin and Athena Analyst](AWSSecurityAnalyticsBootstrap/cfn/Athena_IAM_setup.yml)     | Creates IAM Roles and Policies for a Athena Admin and Athena Analyst Roles designed according to least privilege principals|  All resources created by this template will be deleted when the CloudFormation Stack is deleted. |
